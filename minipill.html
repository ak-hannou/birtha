                                <p id="review">“Micronor did prevent pregnancy but it messed up my hormones terribly. I always had regular periods that weren't painful. After taking Micronor they stopped completely. I was on Micronor for years and my doctor assured me this was normal. Once I decided to stop Micronor my period hasn't come back. It's been 2 years. If anyone is thinking they will want to have children in the future I do no recommend this birth control as it really messed my hormones up.”<br></p>
                                <p id="review">“I’ve been on micronor for over a year now....and I am seriously thinking of stopping them. When I started taking them I had the common side effects until my body adjusted. About three months ago the side effects started up again and have become worse. For preventing a pregnancy, they work well but for mood swings and cramps it’s actually making them worse for me.”<br></p>
                                <p id="review">“I am taking Micronor for over a year now. My doctor prescribed because I have bad migraines, which gets worse with combination pills. I was super happy in the beginning because my migraines stopped completely, but with the time the other side effects became worse and worse: my breasts are extremely swollen and painful, my husband cannot hug me, it really hurts, terrible cramps, spotting for 15 days non stop and mood swings. I had to stop unfortunately. I'm not sure if Cerazette could be better, but looks like is about the same.”<br></p>
