HOWEVER the first month I was on this pill I acquired a huge boil on my hip but I brushed it off thinking it was just a fluke thing.. nope! I’m on month 2 and I’ve now had one on my face and 4 on my legs. Also, my mood swings are outrageous”</p>
                                <p id="review">“This has been the worst birth control pill I’ve ever taken. I was on Sprintec since this year had started and recently started taking previfem (3 months ago) and had not stopped bleeding, mood swings are horrible, and makes you very bloated and gassy, and I would not recommend this pill to anybody !”</p>
                                <p id="review"> “I work at a pharmacy and I get my prescriptions filled there as well. However, my pharmacists constantly switch me between sprintec and previfem and I know they're virtually the same thing. However yet again, every time I get put on previfem, my breasts get very sore by the second week of the pack, I get more acne flare ups, and tend to feel just unwell. It does it's job but I am just miserable on the stuff. I'm having trouble understanding why if it's all the same ingredients why is it making my body feel so different.”</p>
