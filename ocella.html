                                <p id="review">“I went on Ocella about a year ago (freshman year of college, 18) to help with my hormonal acne that I had been struggling with since I was 15. I immediately noticed that I felt a lot more depressed/moody but I was also adjusting to college. Three months in, my acne was the worst it had ever been, but I decided to stick it out. Suddenly around 4-5 months, it started to clear up and my skin has been clear since! I also noticed some weight gain and water retention but that went away over time. I have also developed some issues with anxiety that I never experienced before the pill, but cannot really say whether Ocella directly caused it or not.”</p>
                                <p id="review"> “I was on Ocella for about 14 years. I didn't gain weight nor get acne. It was actually a GREAT experience. I'm now getting off it to clean my system but I highly recommend this pill. I would get my period for about 3 days with no pain.”</p>
