I started lybrel so I can stop my period for a while and have a break from those dark days. I was so worried lybrel would cause mood problems and I'm so relieved it has not. I give it an 8 rather than 10 because it's only been a couple of weeks. There's still time for things to go south but so far I'm so glad I started this! Only wish I'd done it sooner.”</p>
                                <p id="review">“I have been on this pill for nearly 2 years. I have not had a single period and no spotting after the first 3 months. Which has been great because I used to have horrid cramps. On the down side I have become terribly depressed, and have gained a LOT of weight. After the pack that I'm on is out I am going off of this pill.”</p>
                                <p id="review"> “I have been on Lybrel since it came out. It is an absolute miracle pill for me. I tell everyone about it. I have had no bleeding, no cramps since I have been on it. I used to have very heavy bleeding and terrible cramps. This pill has changed my life.”</p>
