I stopped on day 10 because the bleeding was awful. The point to take was to have less period, not to bleed everyday. 3 days after taking it and I have never bled so heavy in all my 34 years of having a period. This stuff is awful!”</p>
                                <p id="review">“I had a great experience on this birth control. I had no weight gain, no hair loss, my skin was generally pretty clear, and the best part were the 4 periods a year. My hair also grew very fast, and was super long and shiny. Only con was that if I didn’t always take it at the same time every day, I would get breakthrough bleeding.”</p>
                                <p id="review"> “Amazing, I was basically out of commission for a 1.5 weeks a month with my period and now&nbsp;on seasonique I only having 4 light and painless once a year. It is a game-changer and I no longer have PMS mood swings and have really helped my relationship!! I love this pill”</p>
