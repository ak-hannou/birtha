                                <p id="review">“I have been taking Gianvi for almost two months. I've had spotting for weeks on end, sometimes an odd pain in my chest, frequent headaches and nausea, vision changes in my right eye and my mood is often really low. I already have anxiety issues and this has magnified them too. I found it helpful to read that others have had some of these odd symptoms, too.”</p>
                                <p id="review">“I was on Gianvi for 8 years (from 18 years to 26 years) and it did WONDERS for my acne on my face and my back. I was prescribed it from my dermatologist. I had a regular period every month once my body adapted to the new hormone changes. When I turned 26 I had to switch to my own insurance and Gianvi was no longer free on my new plan, so I switched to Junel Fe for all of 2020 - biggest mistake of my life. My periods were irregular / I would go months without even getting one, my mood swings were horrible, and my skin started to break out on my back and my face. Last month I went back on my insurance to see how much Gianvi would be because I couldn't be on Junel Fe anymore, and Gianvi was free again! So I immediately switched back and my skin is already starting to improve. Gianvi is one of three qualified combination pills for acne purposes, so I highly recommend this if you are having acne problems.”</p>
                                <p id="review"> “I started Gianvi after 3 months of using Yaz. I’m not happy at all. I’m due to start my 2nd pack today but I think that I’m just going to discontinue using it. Yesterday, I experienced serious mood swings and today isn’t any better. I’ve been an emotional wreck and I don’t like the way that it makes me feel.”</p>
